# MealMates_Proj
BALABABABA~WELCOME to out MealMates Project, and our goal is to help everyone eat well with limited budget :)
This project aims to build a platform where students can form group meal orders to cut delivery fees and reduce individual dining costs. For example, users can team up to split large portions from restaurants like Chinese takeout, allowing each person to try more dishes without overspending.
